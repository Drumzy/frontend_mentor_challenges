### What I learned

#### Grid System

Learning the grid system was initialy overwhelming, but by taking on this challenge, i was able to solidify my understanding.
In this challenge, the second part of the UI contains an image & heading stacked on top of eachother and a side section.

After observing this layout, i landed on using the grid system and by experimenting with dierent classes and configurations,
I was able to see firsthand how the grid system worked and how it could be used to create flexible and responsive designs.
Through this challenge, I not only gained a better understanding of the grid system, but also a newfound confidence in using it for future projects.

Here you can see the layout i landed on:

```html
<div class="grid md:grid-cols-6 gap-5 grid-cols-1 h-2/3">
  <div
    class="col-span-1 row-auto md:row-start-1 md:col-start-1 md:row-end-3 md:col-end-5"
  >
    ...
  </div>
  <div
    class="flex flex-col bg-slate-900 p-5 gap-5 row-auto order-last md:row-start-1 md:col-start-5 md:row-end-5 md:col-end-7"
  >
    ...
  </div>
  <div
    class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-3 justify-evenly p-2 row-auto col-span-1 md:row-start-3 md:col-start-1 md:row-end-5 md:col-end-5"
  >
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Astro Islands

This part is not focus on the design side but rather on thechnical choices i made for this project not specific for this challenge.  
Taking advantage of innovative features can greatly enhance the development process.
AstroJS is a powerful framework that allows for seamless integration of multiple UI frameworks in a single project.  
One of its most impressive features is Astro Lands, which enables developers to bundle JavaScript on the client side only when necessary.  
This approach optimizes performance by reducing the size of the codebase, leading to faster load times and improved user experience.  
By using Astro Lands, developers can leverage the strengths of different UI frameworks, without sacrificing performance or incurring unnecessary bloat.  
This unique capability makes AstroJS a valuable tool for any developer seeking to create dynamic and responsive web applications with a high level of flexibility and customization

To showcase an example :

```astro
<div
  class="w-full md:px-60 p-5 flex flex-col gap-12 bg-slate-50 h-fit shadow-2xl"
>
  <ResponsiveMenu client:idle />
  <HeroSection />
  <LastSection />
</div>
```

Where the "ResponsiveMenu" is a react component with a client directive of idle so that it loads the component only when the main thread is free.

### Continued development

Im happy with the results that turned out after experimenting with different aspects of this challenge.

But there is always a room for improvement, making the images scale better with the screen size would be a great start.

### Useful resources

- [Grid Css Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) - This tool helped me understand the basics of the grid system which was after that was an easy thing to convert them to tailwindcss classes.
- [Astro Client Directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) - official docs of AstroJS about the client directives and UI framework components hydration.
